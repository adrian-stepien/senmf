      "In choosing a cost function to optimize, we'll be picking a noise model. The connection is straightforward in the non-convolutive case. Optimizing the squared error is equivalent to an MLE estimate under Gaussian noise. Optimizing the generalized KL-Divergence is equivalent to an MLE estimate under Poisson noise.\n",

      "If our original data matrix $X$ arose through measurements of some real world process, it is often the case that $X$ is a noisy combination of a small (compared to N) number of signals. Part of our motivation for decomposing $X$ into $A$ and $D$ is to remove some of that noise. If the noise is Poisson, the magnitude of the noise is proportional to the magnitude of the underlying signals. In other words, the greater $X_{ij}$, the more uncertainty we should have about the magnitude of the underlying signal we would like to extract."
